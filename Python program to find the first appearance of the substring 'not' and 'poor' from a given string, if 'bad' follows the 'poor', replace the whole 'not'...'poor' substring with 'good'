# Write a Python program to find the first appearance of the substring 'not' and 'poor' from a given string, if 'bad' follows the 'poor', replace the whole 'not'...'poor' substring with 'good'. Return the resulting string.  
# Sample String : 'The lyrics is not that poor!'
# Expected Result : 'The lyrics is good!'
